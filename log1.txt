Top Questions [...] In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death.

Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948 at age 78 in the compound of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), a large mansion in central New Delhi. His assassin was Nathuram Godse, a Chitpavan Brahmin from Pune, Maharashtra, a Hindu nationalist,[1] a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary organization[2] as well as a member of the Hindu Mahasabha.[3] Godse considered Gandhi to have been too accommodating to Pakistan during the Partition of India of [...] times, at point-blank range, into Gandhi's chest, stomach and groin. Gandhi died at 5:40pm, about half an hour after he was shot.[7] [...] Death[edit]
According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot.[66][67] In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried back into the Birla House, into a bedroom, where he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.[68]

At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time.[67] According to Anthony Parel, Gandhi was also influenced by the Tamil moral text Tirukkuṛaḷ after Leo Tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with "A [...] Gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements.[261] Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence.[305][306][307] King said, "Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics."[308] King sometimes referred to Gandhi as "the little brown saint."[309] Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South
Now Gandhi pushed even harder for home rule, encouraging boycotts of British goods and organizing mass protests. In 1930, he began a massive satyagraha campaign against a British law that forced Indians to purchase British salt instead of producing it locally. Gandhi organized a 241-mile-long protest march to the west coast of Gujarat, where he and his acolytes harvested salt on the shores of the Arabian Sea. In response, Britain imprisoned over 60,000 peaceful protesters and inadvertently [...] He’s been called the “father of India” and a “great soul in beggar’s garb." His nonviolent approach to political change helped India gain independence after nearly a century of British colonial rule. A frail man with a will of iron, he provided a blueprint for future social movements around the world. He was Mahatma Gandhi, and he remains one of the most revered figures in modern history. [...] Ascetic and unflinching, Gandhi changed the face of civil disobedience around the world. Martin Luther King, Jr. drew on his tactics during the Civil Rights Movement, and the Dalai Lama was inspired by his teachings, which are still heralded by those who seek to inspire change without inciting violence.
In the city of Amritsar, British Indian Army soldiers were ordered to open fire on a crowd of 20,000 or so protestors that had begun to grow unruly. Around 400 people were killed, with more than 1,000 injured. From that point on, Mahatma Gandhi’s goal was clear – Indian independence. He soon became a leading figure in the home-rule movement. [...] The movement called for mass boycotts of British goods and institutions. Gandhi implored civil servants to stop working for the British, for students to quit government schools, for soldiers to abandon their posts and for the citizenry to withhold their taxes and avoid buying British goods.
In 1922, he was arrested by the British authorities and pleaded guilty to three counts of sedition, which resulted in a six-year prison sentence, although that was commuted after just two years.
By the autumn of 1920, Gandhi was the dominant figure on the political stage, commanding an influence never before attained by any political leader in India or perhaps in any other country. He refashioned the 35-year-old Indian National Congress (Congress Party) into an effective political instrument of Indian nationalism: from a three-day Christmas-week picnic of the upper middle class in one of the principal cities of India, it became a mass organization with its roots in small towns and [...] satyagrahis, who defied laws and cheerfully lined up for prison. In February 1922 the movement seemed to be on the crest of a rising wave, but, alarmed by a violent outbreak in Chauri Chaura, a remote village in eastern India, Gandhi decided to call off mass civil disobedience. That was a blow to many of his followers, who feared that his self-imposed restraints and scruples would reduce the nationalist struggle to pious futility. Gandhi himself was arrested on March 10, 1922, tried for [...] him from the outside world and to destroy his influence. That was not an easy task. Gandhi soon regained the initiative. In September 1932, while still a prisoner, he embarked on a fast to protest against the British government’s decision to segregate the so-called “untouchables” (the lowest level of the Indian caste system; now called Scheduled Castes [official] or Dalits) by allotting them separate electorates in the new constitution. The fast produced an emotional upheaval in the country,
Indians held a mass protest meeting at Johannesburg in September 1906 and, under Gandhi’s leadership, took a pledge to defy the ordinance if it became law in the teeth of their opposition and to suffer all the penalties resulting from their defiance. Thus was born satyagraha (“devotion to truth”), a new technique for redressing wrongs through inviting, rather than inflicting, suffering, for resisting adversaries without rancor and fighting them without violence. [...] The struggle in South Africa lasted for more than seven years. It had its ups and downs, but under Gandhi’s leadership, the small Indian minority kept up its resistance against heavy odds. Hundreds of Indians chose to sacrifice their livelihood and liberty rather than submit to laws repugnant to their conscience and self-respect. In the final phase of the movement in 1913, hundreds of Indians, including women, went to jail, and thousands of Indian workers who had struck work in the mines

Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India.

[...] Indians widely describe Gandhi as the Father of the Nation.[336][337][338][339][340][341] Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as "The Father of the Nation".[342] On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as "Father of the Nation".[343][344] He is also conferred the title "Bapu"[339] (Gujarati: endearment for father,[340] papa[340][341]).

Top Questions [...] In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death.

Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948 at age 78 in the compound of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), a large mansion in central New Delhi. His assassin was Nathuram Godse, a Chitpavan Brahmin from Pune, Maharashtra, a Hindu nationalist,[1] a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu paramilitary organization[2] as well as a member of the Hindu Mahasabha.[3] Godse considered Gandhi to have been too accommodating to Pakistan during the Partition of India of [...] times, at point-blank range, into Gandhi's chest, stomach and groin. Gandhi died at 5:40pm, about half an hour after he was shot.[7] [...] Death[edit]
According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot.[66][67] In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried back into the Birla House, into a bedroom, where he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.[68]

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[c] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)[2] was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.

The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.[3] [...] In 1906, the Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time.[67] According to Anthony Parel, Gandhi was also influenced by the Tamil moral text Tirukkuṛaḷ after Leo Tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with "A [...] Gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements.[261] Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence.[305][306][307] King said, "Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics."[308] King sometimes referred to Gandhi as "the little brown saint."[309] Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South
Now Gandhi pushed even harder for home rule, encouraging boycotts of British goods and organizing mass protests. In 1930, he began a massive satyagraha campaign against a British law that forced Indians to purchase British salt instead of producing it locally. Gandhi organized a 241-mile-long protest march to the west coast of Gujarat, where he and his acolytes harvested salt on the shores of the Arabian Sea. In response, Britain imprisoned over 60,000 peaceful protesters and inadvertently [...] He’s been called the “father of India” and a “great soul in beggar’s garb." His nonviolent approach to political change helped India gain independence after nearly a century of British colonial rule. A frail man with a will of iron, he provided a blueprint for future social movements around the world. He was Mahatma Gandhi, and he remains one of the most revered figures in modern history. [...] Ascetic and unflinching, Gandhi changed the face of civil disobedience around the world. Martin Luther King, Jr. drew on his tactics during the Civil Rights Movement, and the Dalai Lama was inspired by his teachings, which are still heralded by those who seek to inspire change without inciting violence.
In the city of Amritsar, British Indian Army soldiers were ordered to open fire on a crowd of 20,000 or so protestors that had begun to grow unruly. Around 400 people were killed, with more than 1,000 injured. From that point on, Mahatma Gandhi’s goal was clear – Indian independence. He soon became a leading figure in the home-rule movement. [...] The movement called for mass boycotts of British goods and institutions. Gandhi implored civil servants to stop working for the British, for students to quit government schools, for soldiers to abandon their posts and for the citizenry to withhold their taxes and avoid buying British goods.
In 1922, he was arrested by the British authorities and pleaded guilty to three counts of sedition, which resulted in a six-year prison sentence, although that was commuted after just two years.
By the autumn of 1920, Gandhi was the dominant figure on the political stage, commanding an influence never before attained by any political leader in India or perhaps in any other country. He refashioned the 35-year-old Indian National Congress (Congress Party) into an effective political instrument of Indian nationalism: from a three-day Christmas-week picnic of the upper middle class in one of the principal cities of India, it became a mass organization with its roots in small towns and [...] satyagrahis, who defied laws and cheerfully lined up for prison. In February 1922 the movement seemed to be on the crest of a rising wave, but, alarmed by a violent outbreak in Chauri Chaura, a remote village in eastern India, Gandhi decided to call off mass civil disobedience. That was a blow to many of his followers, who feared that his self-imposed restraints and scruples would reduce the nationalist struggle to pious futility. Gandhi himself was arrested on March 10, 1922, tried for [...] him from the outside world and to destroy his influence. That was not an easy task. Gandhi soon regained the initiative. In September 1932, while still a prisoner, he embarked on a fast to protest against the British government’s decision to segregate the so-called “untouchables” (the lowest level of the Indian caste system; now called Scheduled Castes [official] or Dalits) by allotting them separate electorates in the new constitution. The fast produced an emotional upheaval in the country,
Indians held a mass protest meeting at Johannesburg in September 1906 and, under Gandhi’s leadership, took a pledge to defy the ordinance if it became law in the teeth of their opposition and to suffer all the penalties resulting from their defiance. Thus was born satyagraha (“devotion to truth”), a new technique for redressing wrongs through inviting, rather than inflicting, suffering, for resisting adversaries without rancor and fighting them without violence. [...] The struggle in South Africa lasted for more than seven years. It had its ups and downs, but under Gandhi’s leadership, the small Indian minority kept up its resistance against heavy odds. Hundreds of Indians chose to sacrifice their livelihood and liberty rather than submit to laws repugnant to their conscience and self-respect. In the final phase of the movement in 1913, hundreds of Indians, including women, went to jail, and thousands of Indian workers who had struck work in the mines

Final Summary: 
:
Here's a summary of the fact-checking process regarding the claims about "Apple":

Based on the available search results, the claim that "Apple" is a porn star is false. While there are mentions of porn stars with similar names like "Apple Juice" and "Candy Apples," there's no evidence to suggest that someone named "Apple" is a porn star.

Similarly, the claim that "Apple" is a person is also false. The search results primarily refer to "Apple" as a company and its employees. Although people can have Apple IDs, this doesn't imply that the company itself is a person.

Regarding the claim that "Apple" is a performer in the adult entertainment industry, the provided context does not offer enough conclusive evidence to confirm or deny this statement. The search results mention adult film performers and the adult entertainment industry in general, and also the company Apple's position on the rise of facetime porn, but do not directly associate the name "Apple" with a performer in that industry.

Two NASA astronauts have returned to Earth after spending nine months stranded in space.
Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore departed the International Space Station (ISS) early on Tuesday morning and splashed down off the coast of Florida after a journey of 17 hours. Boeing’s Starliner, their original return spacecraft, was deemed unsafe for the journey home, forcing the astronauts to stay in space much longer than planned.

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Willmore return to earth after 286 days in space, but their challenges have only begun.

Sunita Lyn "Suni" Williams (née Pandya; born September 19, 1965) is an American astronaut, current commander of the International Space Station, retired U.S. Navy officer, and one of the most experienced spacewalkers with nine spacewalks (second most for a woman) and a total time of 62 hours and 6 minutes (fourth overall, current record-holder for most hours spent during spacewalks by a woman). In August 2018 she was assigned to the first operational mission flight (Starliner-1) to the International Space Station of Boeing CST-100 Starliner.[33] On April 18, 2022, NASA said that it had not yet finalized which of the cadre of Starliner astronauts, including Barry Wilmore, Michael Fincke, and Williams, would fly on the Boeing Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission or the first operational Starliner mission.[34] On June 16, 2022, NASA confirmed that CFT would be a two-person mission, consisting of Wilmore and Williams.[35] On June 5, 2024, Williams became the first woman to fly on a flight test of an orbital spacecraft when the Starliner launched to orbit with Williams as the spacecraft's pilot.[36]
On Tuesday (March 18) NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore splashed down into the Gulf of Mexico inside a SpaceX crew capsule, ending a more than nine-month stay in space that was originally slated to last just a few weeks. When their capsule was finally opened, the astronauts were carried out of the spacecraft and loaded onto stretchers. [...] The astronauts were not sick or injured; the reason for this procedure has nothing to do with Williams and Wilmore's specific mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS), but is simply a matter of protocol that all astronauts must follow, experts told Live Science.

When astronauts return to Earth from space, they can't immediately walk upon landing. This is due to temporary changes to the body that occur in space — a fact that NASA addresses with strict safety procedures.
Williams is the second India-descent American astronaut of international acclaim. The first was Haryana native Kalpana Chawla, who died in 2003 after the Columbia space shuttle disintegrated after re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. [...] All About Crew-9: NASA Astronaut Sunita Williams
Sunita (Suni) L Williams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space missions, Expeditions 14/15 (December 9, 2006 to June 22, 2007) and 32/33 (July 14 to November 18, 2012).
As a member of the Expedition 14 crew, Williams served as Flight Engineer. While onboard, she established a world record for females with four spacewalks totaling 29 hours and 17 minutes. [...] ### 28,000 Kmph, 1,600 Degrees: Fireball Test Before Sunita Williams Landed

The search context states that the bandh was called by Pro-Kannada organizations, not a political party. Although Kannada Vatal Party led the bandh, it was called by Pro-Kannada organizations.
</OTHER_RESPONSE>Result: CANNOT SAY
Reasoning: The search context provides conflicting information. Some sources suggest minimal disruption ("normal life continuing in most districts," "business as usual," "impact was minimal"), while others anticipate disruptions ("disruption in services and transportation," "Karnataka is on high alert"). Therefore, it's impossible to definitively say whether the bandh resulted in significant disruptions to daily life based on the provided context.
Questions:
1. Did public transportation services operate normally during the bandh?
2. Were schools and businesses closed due to the bandh?
3. Were there any reports of violence or property damage related to the bandh?
</OTHER_RESPONSE>





Final Summary: 
:
Here's a summary of the fact-checking results regarding the Karnataka bandh on March 22, 2025:

*   **Occurrence of Bandh:** It is confirmed that a bandh did occur in Karnataka on March 22, 2025.
*   **Statewide Event:** The bandh was indeed a statewide event.
*   **Organizer:** The bandh was called by pro-Kannada organizations, with the Kannada Vatal Party taking a leading role.
*   **Disruptions to Daily Life:** Reports regarding the extent of disruption to daily life are mixed. While some reports indicate that daily life continued as usual in many districts, others suggest potential disruptions to services and transportation in busy areas.

Please provide the complete statement, and I'll extract the facts to be verified and frame yes-or-no questions for each fact.

Gemini responses: :

Reasoning: "This confidence may be derived in part through Adani's relationship with SEBI. Gautam Adani met the SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Buch twice in"
The text indicates a relationship between Gautam Adani and SEBI, as he met with the SEBI Chairperson twice.




Llama responses: :
Result: FALSE
Reasoning: "Sebi has been investigating the Adani group since at least January 2014, when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence referred a case of alleged" 
The search context clearly states that SEBI has been investigating the Adani group since at least January 2014, which implies that Gautam Adani is not connected to SEBI in a positive or official capacity, but rather is being investigated by SEBI.None



Final responses: :
Result: CANNOT SAY
Reasoning: While the provided text mentions Gautam Adani's relationship with SEBI and his meetings with the SEBI Chairperson, it doesn't explicitly confirm a direct connection in terms of employment, ownership, or control. The context also mentions SEBI investigating the Adani group, which could indicate an arm's length relationship. Therefore, I cannot definitively say if Gautam Adani is "connected" to SEBI without more information.

Questions:
1. Is Gautam Adani an employee of SEBI?
2. Does Gautam Adani hold a position of authority within SEBI?
3. Does Gautam Adani have any ownership stake in SEBI?
